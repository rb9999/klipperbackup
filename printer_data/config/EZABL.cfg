#### PROBE SETTINGS ####

[probe] 
pin: ^!PC3            #### MUST BE SET #####
#   Probe detection pin. The Signal pin going to the EZABL
x_offset: 70       #### MUST BE SET #####
#   The distance (in mm) between the probe and the nozzle along the
#   x-axis. The default is 0.
#   If the probe is LEFT of the nozzle, this number is negative. (ex: -12)
#   If the probe is RIGHT of the nozzle, this number is positive. (ex: 12)
y_offset: 0       #### MUST BE SET #####
#   The distance (in mm) between the probe and the nozzle along the
#   y-axis. The default is 0.
#   If the probe is AHEAD of the nozzle, this number is negative. (ex: -12)
#   If the probe is BEHIND of the nozzles, this number is positive. (ex: 12)
#z_offset:
#   The distance (in mm) between the bed and the nozzle when the probe
#   triggers. This parameter must be provided and must be a POSITIVE number (ex: 2.1)
speed: 5		#### UF standard is 5mm/s, 8mm/s for FastProbe and 15mm/s for Superfast####
#   Speed (in mm/s) of the Z axis when probing. The default is 5mm/s.
samples: 2      ### UF Standard is 2####
#   The number of times to probe each point. The probed z-values will
#   be averaged. The default is to probe 1 time.
#sample_retract_dist: 2.0
#   The distance (in mm) to lift the toolhead between each sample (if
#   sampling more than once). The default is 2mm.
#samples_result: average
#   The calculation method when sampling more than once - either
#   "median" or "average". The default is average.
#samples_tolerance: 0.100
#   The maximum Z distance (in mm) that a sample may differ from other
#   samples. If this tolerance is exceeded then either an error is
#   reported or the attempt is restarted (see
#   samples_tolerance_retries). The default is 0.100mm.
lift_speed: 8


#### Z Safe Home ####

[safe_z_home]
home_xy_position: 80, 150      #### MUST BE SET ##### Can be calculated at https://www.th3dstudio.com/klipper-abl-mesh-homing-calculator/ 
#   A X, Y coordinate (e.g. 100, 100) where the Z homing should be
#   performed. This parameter must be provided.
#speed: 50.0
#   Speed at which the toolhead is moved to the safe Z home
#   coordinate. The default is 50 mm/s
z_hop: 5  #### UF Standard is 5mm ####
#   Distance (in mm) to lift the Z axis prior to homing. This is
#   applied to any homing command, even if it doesn't home the Z axis.
#   If the Z axis is already homed and the current Z position is less
#   than z_hop, then this will lift the head to a height of z_hop. If
#   the Z axis is not already homed the head is lifted by z_hop.
#   The default is to not implement Z hop.
z_hop_speed: 10.0
#   Speed (in mm/s) at which the Z axis is lifted prior to homing. The
#   default is 15 mm/s.


#### BED MESH ####

[bed_mesh]
#speed: 50
#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the calibration.
#   The default is 50.
#horizontal_move_z: 5
#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
mesh_min: 70, 50          #### MUST BE SET ##### Can be calculated at https://www.th3dstudio.com/klipper-abl-mesh-homing-calculator/ 
#   Defines the minimum X, Y coordinate of the mesh for rectangular
#   beds. This coordinate is relative to the probe's location. This
#   will be the first point probed, nearest to the origin. This
#   parameter must be provided for rectangular beds.
mesh_max: 250, 250          #### MUST BE SET ##### Can be calculated at https://www.th3dstudio.com/klipper-abl-mesh-homing-calculator/ 
#   Defines the maximum X, Y coordinate of the mesh for rectangular
#   beds. Adheres to the same principle as mesh_min, however this will
#   be the furthest point probed from the bed's origin. This parameter
#   must be provided for rectangular beds.
probe_count: 3, 3 #### UF standard is 3, 3 ####
#   For rectangular beds, this is a comma separate pair of integer
#   values X, Y defining the number of points to probe along each
#   axis. A single value is also valid, in which case that value will
#   be applied to both axes. Default is 3, 3.
